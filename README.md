- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nickjdonaldson
- ðŸ‘€ i'm new to coding, I am a telecommunications central office tech, so i'm very skilled in electronics and troubleshooting. I have dabbled with coding
- but it never clicked. Now with aurdino and being able to intergrate code with real projects to do something makes it so much fun. 
- 
- Thanks to @bitsanddroids for amazing lessons on ardrino & code. 
- Not sure where this will go but I really enjoy it and think i can make some great projects with aurdino & the teensy.
